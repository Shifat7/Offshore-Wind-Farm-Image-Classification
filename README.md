# Offshore-Wind-Farm-Image-Classification

This project provides a comprehensive solution for detecting and tracking offshore wind turbines using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 satellites. Leveraging advanced algorithms and geospatial analysis techniques, the solution processes SAR imagery, applies thresholding, and extracts persistent polygons representing wind turbines over multiple time periods. The resulting workflow not only identifies wind farms but also merges closely located polygons to generate accurate representations of the turbines. The project's outcomes contribute to the Global Renewables Watch, enabling researchers and policymakers to gain valuable insights into the global landscape of renewable energy platforms for the Microsoft Space Hackathon 2023 in collaboration with NASA and ASA. 

The code contains the implementation, data processing scripts, and documentation necessary to replicate and extend this innovative wind turbine detection solution using SAR data.
